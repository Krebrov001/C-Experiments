# Experiments and Investigations in C++

This is a collection of small programs for experimenting with advanced features of C++

I like learning about C/C++ during my own free time. I made these programs to experiment with various features of the programming language, for solidifying my foundational knowledge about it, and going beyond what is taught at university. Some of these programs are inspired by books, YouTube videos, or StackOverflow posts where I first found out about a certain feature or concept, learning on my own. These programs have a varying complexity.

These programs are organized into folders according to the important concept which they demonstrate.

Some of these files are actually symbolic links to files in other folders. If a given program demonstrates more than one concept, I put the code itself into one folder, and then I make symbolic links to this file from other relevant folders.
