 * @section DESCRIPTION
 *
 * This program demonstrates how a recursive implementation of the Fibonacci algorithm
 * is inefficient compared to the iterative implementation.
 * This is because the time complexity for the recursive algorithm grows just like the
 * Fibonacci sequence itself because the recurrence relation is defined in terms of the
 * previous two numbers.
 * A certain previous element in the Fibonacci sequence may be calculated more than once.
 *
 * This program was inspired by:
 * mycodeschool Why recursion is not always good
 * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM9sA5PtznY&index=2&list=PL2_aWCzGMAwLz3g66WrxFGSXvSsvyfzCO
 *
 * The thing is that the naive recursive algorithm without memoization keeps calculating
 * the lower-order terms in the Fibonacci sequence over and over again.
 * Fib(0), Fib(1), Fib(2) are called every single time when the are a dependency for a
 * recursive call before them in the stack.
 * Even though these terms have been already calculated, the recursive algorithm doesn't
 * know about them, and so it does unnecessary redundant work.
 *
 * My program maintains a vector of ints where each element contains the number of times
 * the corresponding recursive call has been calculated.
 * When all the recursive calls have completed, and the recursive algorithm returns the final
 * result, Fib(n), the vector has put on record the number of recursive calls made to calculate
 * a given previous element in the Fibonacci sequence.
 *
 * One interesting observation is that for any original input size n,
 * the number of times that F(1) has been called == fib[n]
 * This is because F(1) returns 1 and F(1) is the base case.
 * All of the recursive function calls return values that are made up of the base case value,
 * or "atoms" of the recursion. The whole is equal to the num of its parts.
 * As many calls to F(1) are made as they are necessary to build up the final value.
 * If we want to build up Fib(6) == 8, we need to get 8 atoms, and so call F(1) 8 times.

/**
 * This function calculates the Fibonacci number fib[n]
 * It also counts how many times each recursive function call is calculated.
 *
 * @param int n - The fib[n] number to calculate.
 *
 * @param std::vector<int>& times - This vector contains the number of times each recursive
 *        Fibonacci function call had been calculated for the total running time of the algorithm.
 *        times.at(0) contains the number of times Fib(0) had been calculated.
 *        times.at(1) contains the number of times Fib(1) had been calculated.
 *        times.at(2) contains the number of times Fib(2) had been calculated.
 *         ...
 *        The vector is pass by reference. It lives in the main() function.
 *        It's length is the n + 1 which is input from the user in the main() function.
 *
 * @return int - returns fib[n]

/**
 * This function finds the length (in number of digits) of the longest int value in the vector.
 * This is because I want all values in the vector to be printed with the same width in chars
 * so that they will be aligned nicely.
 *
 * This is the first version of the function.
 * It uses the std::string library to get the length of the int value as a string.
 * The benefit is that using a standard C++ library takes approximately constant time to find
 * the length of every number.
 * The disadvantage is that this is a C++ specific thing, and I am not entirely sure how
 * efficient it is to use std::string either.
 *
 * @param int std::vector<int>& times - The values in the vector can have any length, and I want to
 *                                      find the length of the longest int value.
 *
 * @return int - The length (in printable digits) of the longest int value in the vector.
